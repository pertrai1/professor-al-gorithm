# Learn AI – Build and Deploy an AI Agent with Topcoder MCP on Hugging Face

## Challenge Details

**Technology Focus:** Development of AI Agents using the Model Context Protocol (MCP)
**Submission Duration:** 21 days
**Agent Type:** Any form of intelligent application is allowed—such as chatbots, virtual assistants, research tools, code generators, or data visualization agents.
Creativity: Participants are encouraged to push boundaries and design original, inventive AI applications.
**Functionality:** The AI agent must address a clearly defined problem or purpose and deliver impactful, practical results.
**Implementation Requirements:**

- The AI agent must be designed to run within a [Hugging Face Space](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/spaces-overview).
- You can use any SDK or programming language, as long as it functions correctly in the Hugging Face Space environment.
- The agent must run smoothly on the default free-tier hardware (CPU Basic) provided by Hugging Face—no GPU usage required.
- It must connect to and interact with the Topcoder MCP server and deliver clear, purposeful results through an intuitive and user-friendly interface.

## Submission Requirements

- A fully functional AI Agent application, either as a downloadable codebase (zip file) or a publicly accessible Hugging Face Space link—or both.
- The submission must be based on a clearly defined use case that addresses a specific problem. Participants should also include a simple, clear document (as part of the submission) that outlines the problem being solved, the rationale behind the chosen use case, and how the AI agent addresses it. This clarity should also be reflected in the agent’s implementation and user experience.
- Accompanying documentation that clearly explains how to deploy, configure, and run the AI agent on Hugging Face Spaces.
- An optional demo video (up to 5 minutes) showcasing the agent’s core functionality and how it addresses the defined use case.
